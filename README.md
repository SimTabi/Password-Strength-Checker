Password-Strength-Checker
=========================

A basic password strength checking page, using: jquery, bootstrap, mustache, and zxcvbn.js from dropbox.

I made this primarily to end arguments over password strengths, and to work with some interesting javascript tools.

An added bonus to using all javascript for this project is all calculation is done client side, so the passwords never leave the browser.
